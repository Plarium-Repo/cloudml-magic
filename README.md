# cloudml-magic - Plarium Fork
cloudml-magic is a Jupyter Notebook Magics for interactively working with [Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/).
Your Tensorflow or Keras code on Notebook will run on ML Engine, just by running cells.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, prepare [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) project, enable billing and install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads).

Also this magics use Application Default Credentials.
To activate the credentials, enter
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

```

**To use** this magics, enter the following command in your notebook.

```py
in [1]: %load_ext cloudmlmagic
```

That's it!

# How to use

## %ml_init
This magic initializes your cloud ml job request. Do NOT forget to initialize before adding code or run.

Example:

```py
in [2]: %ml_init -projectId PROJECTID -bucket BUCKET -region us-central1 -scaleTier BASIC -runtimeVersion 1.2
```

### Install external libraries
If you want to run codes with external libraries like Keras, h5py, add following dict below the `%ml_init` magic.

```
{'install_requires': ['keras', 'h5py', 'Pillow']}
```

## %ml_code
This magic adds the block into uploading package.

## %ml_run
To run a training job, add this magic on your code block.

**Run on local Machine**  
Do not add this magic, or add `%ml_run`

**Run on Cloud ML Engine**  
add `%ml_run cloud`
